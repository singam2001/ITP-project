1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,713
You are being watched.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,798
The government has a secret system.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,386
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,388
I know because I built it.

5
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:18,892
I designed the machine to detect
acts of terror, but it sees everything.

6
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,979
Violent crimes involving
ordinary people.

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,439
People like you.

8
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,733
Crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

9
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,445
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

10
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,363
But I needed a partner.

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,532
Someone with the skills to intervene.

12
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:39,288
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,248
You will never find us.

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:45,961
But victim or perpetrator,
if your number's up, we'll find you.

15
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,186
When you find that one person
who connects you to the world...

16
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,856
...you become someone different.

17
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,234
Someone better.

18
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,281
When that person is taken from you...

19
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,412
Wait for me.

20
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,581
...what do you become then?

21
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,752
Are you okay, mister?

22
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,759
What happened to you?

23
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,516
I think I quit my job.

24
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,768
Next stop, New Rochelle.

25
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,822
Morning, Finch.

26
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,119
You're off to an early start, Mr. Reese.

27
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,454
Maybe I'm trying to impress the boss.

28
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,206
You should have called first.

29
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,709
As it stands, our docket is clear.

30
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,086
We don't have a number?

31
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,922
- You sound disappointed.
- Oh, a little surprised.

32
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,135
No one in New York is in danger
or planning to hurt someone?

33
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,470
If they are,
they're keeping it to themselves.

34
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,932
Anyway, I think you've earned
some time off. Especially today.

35
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,602
Or did you think I didn't know?

36
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,523
Happy birthday.

37
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,818
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

38
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,029
Now go. Do whatever you do
when you're not here.

39
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,244
- You don't know what that is?
- I respect your privacy, John.

40
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,997
Obviously.

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,731
Cannon eight to six.

42
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,989
Horse two to three.

43
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,992
Ha-ha-ha. Are you sure?

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,077
You tell me, Han.

45
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,787
As I recall, John...

46
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,248
...you don't make any move
you're not sure of.

47
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,251
You're not working today?

48
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,962
My boss gave me the day off.

49
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,422
It's my birthday.

50
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,801
- Thank you.
- Ha-ha-ha.

51
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,511
Did you get any gifts?

52
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,056
One.

53
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,692
A key.

54
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,819
To what?

55
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,031
Good question.

56
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,248
Detective Carter.

57
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,375
Special Agent Donnelly.

58
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,502
How goes your hunt
for our mystery man?

59
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,631
That's why I'm here. I promised I'd keep
you in the loop on our investigation.

60
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,552
So we've been looking into
a smuggling ring that was broken up...

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,139
...a couple months back. The leader
was suspected of having CIA ties.

62
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,684
- He skipped before he could be charged.
- I recall.

63
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,228
Yeah, well, we think your guy
was working for him.

64
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,730
CSU found prints
and some carbonized blood...

65
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:37,234
...along with the body of a member of
the ring in the trunk of a car.

66
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,653
When they ran the blood,
they got a DNA hit...

67
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,656
...on a cold case up in New Rochelle
from 2011.

68
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,909
- What kind of cold case?
- Uh, suspected homicide.

69
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,161
Real-estate developer
named Peter Arndt.

70
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,540
- Real-estate developer?
- Arndt was up to his eyeballs in debt.

71
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,002
Lost his investors' money. We think one
of them had him taken out...

72
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,463
...and hired your guy to do the job.
And he made some mistakes.

73
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,718
Someone in New Rochelle has to know
something. And then we'll be close.

74
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,804
- Close to what?
- Finding out who this man really is.

75
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,226
Uh, well, um, thank you for the update.

76
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,603
- How'd you like to assist?
- Assist?

77
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,023
- Up in New Rochelle.
- Uh, I would love to, but...

78
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,276
You're the reason we're onto this guy.
You should be part of taking him down.

79
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,155
- I'll let you know.
- Thanks.

80
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,161
- Yeah.
- Hello, detective.

81
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,705
There's something I need to discuss.

82
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,751
Yeah, I got something for you too.

83
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,473
Never pegged you
as the cues-and-brews type.

84
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,350
All the more reason to come here.

85
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,186
Once we become predictable,
we become vulnerable.

86
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,771
If you say so.

87
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,524
What can I get you?
- Uh, club soda for me. Thanks.

88
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,693
When I called,
you said you had something.

89
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,571
You know about a case
up in New Rochelle?

90
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,824
I'll take that as a yes.

91
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,952
FBI linked your partner's DNA
to a crime scene.

92
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,248
- Agent Donnelly, no doubt.
- He wants me along for the ride.

93
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,210
- Perhaps that wouldn't be a bad thing.
- How do you mean?

94
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,004
If there was any evidence
that threatened our friend...

95
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,132
...I'm confident you would find it
before Donnelly would.

96
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,928
Are you suggesting
I obstruct a federal investigation?

97
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:33,058
What you did with that evidence
would be entirely your concern.

98
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,521
You had to talk to me about something.

99
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,816
Oh, it was nothing important.
We'll talk again when you get back.

100
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,112
Thanks for the drink.

101
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,621
Anything else?

102
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,499
- I'll just take the check, please.
- Okay.

103
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,339
Here you go.

104
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,508
Thank you.

105
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,654
This is Jessica. You missed me.

106
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,989
Leave a message.

107
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,703
- Do you need any help?
- Yes, I'm, uh, looking for someone.

108
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,665
A nurse. Jessica Arndt.

109
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,376
I'm an old friend.
She might not work here anymore.

110
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,670
She was always talking
about moving away.

111
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,172
Um... Mm...

112
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,340
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

113
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,176
Jessica died in a car accident.

114
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,264
About two months ago.

115
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,188
She said she would wait.

116
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,814
I'm so sorry.

117
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,776
I think I have her husband's number here
if you wanted to reach out.

118
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,745
Sorry.

119
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,337
- Has she left the apartment?
- Not yet.

120
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,090
- What's your interest in this broad?
- That's not your concern.

121
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,842
Just keep an eye out.

122
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,721
Karen Garner. She's wanted
for identity theft, passing bad checks.

123
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,598
Warrant's out. Your girl's a felon.

124
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,601
I'm aware of her apparent troubles
with the law, detective.

125
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,063
- I'm concerned she may be in danger.
- What makes you think that?

126
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,566
"Karen Garner" is an alias that's only
been around for three months.

127
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,778
She has no credit history,
only leaves to go to work.

128
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,822
- Constantly looking over her shoulder.
- She's hiding out.

129
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,366
Or on the run, more likely.

130
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,912
- Maybe she's trying to plan something.
- Yes, perhaps she's a master criminal.

131
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,832
But maybe she's a scared woman trying
to stay a step ahead of her abuser.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,292
Yeah, right.

133
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,504
Let me ask you. Why am I planted here
instead of Wonder Boy?

134
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,172
Mr. Reese is otherwise engaged.

135
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,050
And you are not to contact him
regarding this matter.

136
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,136
You and I will handle this ourselves.

137
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,390
One out, bottom
of the fifth, it's Derek Mendler up next.

138
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,600
Mendler with a.233 batting average.

139
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,603
Six runs batted in.

140
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,022
Velasco with the pitch.

141
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,693
Fastball in there for called strike
and the count is nothing and one.

142
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,446
You can see Hernandez getting up
on that outside corner...

143
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,157
...and Velasco nails the location
at 93 miles per hour.

144
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,836
Detective Carter, welcome to New Rochelle.

145
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,921
Glad to see you took me up
on my offer.

146
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,798
Here's what we know.

147
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,968
Arndt was playing it fast and loose
with his investors' money.

148
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,054
He ended up losing it on bad land deals
and a gambling habit.

149
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,099
When he exhausted his credit,
he was forced to take money...

150
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,643
...from less reputable lenders.
- Loan sharks.

151
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:07,147
His bookie gave us the names
of a couple guys he introduced Arndt to.

152
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,108
- And we're checking them out.
- Says he was married.

153
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,069
- Wife deceased. What happened to her?
- Car accident.

154
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,447
Two months
before Arndt went missing.

155
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,490
Bad one. She was killed,
he nearly was.

156
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,827
Anyway, by that point,
Arndt was completely under water.

157
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,080
Shortly after he left the hospital,
he went missing.

158
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,915
They find a body?

159
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,586
No, but given the amount of blood
spilled, it's doubtful Arndt survived.

160
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,173
Doesn't sound like my guy's M.O.
He usually covers his tracks.

161
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,508
Another reason we think
it was his first job.

162
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,344
It was messy, violent.

163
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,223
Probably figured it would be easy then
found out he had a fight on his hands.

164
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,809
We located one of the loan sharks.

165
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,104
- You talk to the detectives?
- No, I had their files sent over.

166
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,733
- I'd like to speak with them.
- Sure. Let me know if you find anything.

167
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,735
Will do.

168
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,591
- Anything yet, detective?
- Yup, our girl's on her way to work.

169
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,135
And you're right.
Someone's got this girl spooked.

170
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,724
- How long am I gonna have to tail her?
- Long enough for me to identify...

171
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,643
...who she's hiding from.

172
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,150
- Hey, you see a woman come here?
- Yeah, she asked to use the bathroom.

173
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,443
Detective?

174
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,903
Hang on.

175
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,919
So if I were to speculate as to the reason
for your labored breathing...

176
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,588
- I lost her.
- That would be it.

177
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,633
- What do you want me to do?
- Go back to your day job.

178
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,301
I'll handle it from here.

179
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,151
- Hey, what can I get you?
- Oh...

180
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,402
Just some information.

181
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,072
I was here last night. I thought I saw
my neighbor working. Karen Garner?

182
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,074
- Yeah, that's right.
- I was passing by.

183
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,118
I thought I'd see if I could catch her.

184
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,454
Normally you would,
but she called out today.

185
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,540
Another time then.
I'm sure I'll see her around.

186
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,259
Excuse me.

187
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,137
I couldn't help overhear
your conversation at the bar.

188
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,640
- You're friends with Karen Garner?
- More of an acquaintance, actually.

189
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,393
Brad Jennings, U.S. Marshals Service.

190
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,729
Is Karen in some kind of trouble,
deputy?

191
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,566
Karen Garner, also known
as Sarah Atkins, is a wanted fugitive.

192
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,319
- I'm trying to locate her.
- Don't know how I can help.

193
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,654
I thought I heard you say
you were neighbors.

194
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,406
Yes. You did.

195
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,367
So maybe you could tell me
where you live, Mr?

196
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,370
- I'd prefer not to get involved.
- I'm not asking you to.

197
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,456
I'm just trying to get your address.

198
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,418
Now if you'd prefer, we can do this down
at the field office.

199
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,378
Hello, Harold.

200
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,714
Detective Stills, Organized Crime.

201
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,467
This guy you're talking to is my C.I.

202
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,302
He's a confidential informant?

203
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,514
And money launderer
for the late Don Moretti.

204
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,933
Hey, I've got some questions for him.

205
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,686
You were risking his cover
by even approaching him.

206
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,064
Let's go.

207
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,566
What did he want?

208
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,401
Just to ask me some questions.

209
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,530
Funny. I've got a few of those
for you too, Harold.

210
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,706
Am I to assume
that you were following me?

211
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,961
I think the bigger question is
are you working a case without me?

212
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,421
I feared with this case,
you had sensitivities.

213
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,967
- I thought it best to let you sit it out.
- What kind of sensitivities?

214
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,720
Her name, or at least her aliases...

215
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,057
...are Karen Garner and Sarah Atkins.

216
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,726
She has warrants
for identity theft and bad checks.

217
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,187
But I don't think
she's a potential perpetrator.

218
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,231
I believe she's on the run
from someone.

219
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,317
- Who?
- Likely someone she was close to.

220
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,073
When I was first building
the machine...

221
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:32,328
...I kept seeing the same numbers,
a week, a month, six months apart.

222
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,374
Usually women.

223
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,837
I thought it was a mistake. How could
anyone's life be repeatedly threatened?

224
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,381
And then I realized...

225
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,844
...they were living with the person
who would eventually kill them.

226
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:57,353
I've been working to uncover who she is.
It might help us identify the threat.

227
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:05,653
Send me her address, and we'll finish
discussing my sensitivities later.

228
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,841
Hello, Karen.

229
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,384
Or do you prefer Sarah?

230
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,347
- Who the hell are you?
- Someone who wants to help you.

231
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,640
You a cop?

232
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,516
No.

233
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,436
But I know you're running
from someone. Who is it?

234
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,898
Boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend? Husband?

235
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,861
- Husband.
- I'm gonna ask you one last time.

236
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,573
- Who are you?
- My name is John.

237
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,326
And I help people
out of tough situations.

238
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,203
What do you know
about my situation?

239
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,082
I know it was bad enough for you to
leave your home, your life, everything.

240
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,627
And I know you'll have to keep running,
Karen...

241
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,713
...if nobody stops him.

242
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,968
It's Sarah.

243
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,971
My name is Sarah.

244
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,474
What if I said you could stop running,
Sarah?

245
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,768
I'd say you don't know my husband.

246
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,147
Mr. Reese, I traced Karen's former alias,
Sarah Atkins...

247
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,149
...to a Chicago apartment.

248
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,611
Manager said she'd paid rent
using checks with a different name.

249
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,030
He's sending me one of them now.

250
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,282
Sarah Jennings.

251
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,368
Jennings, he's her husband.

252
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,744
He's the marshal.

253
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,456
- How did you know that?
- That's not important.

254
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,875
- What's important is we can help you.
- We?

255
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,546
I have a colleague who will watch
over you while I take care of things.

256
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,924
- We need you to stay here.
- What is it you're gonna do?

257
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:54,387
Make it so you don't have
to be afraid anymore.

258
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,479
- Everything we have on Peter Arndt.
- Thanks.

259
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,649
Did this look like a professional hit
to you?

260
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,028
It's hard to say. Don't get a lot
of contract killings up this way.

261
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,073
But this guy Arndt owed a lot of money
to some dangerous people.

262
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,492
And this?

263
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,871
Report from a car crash
Arndt and his wife were in. Single car.

264
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,831
Husband swerved to avoid a deer.

265
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,249
Wife was killed.

266
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:28,546
Hell of a thing. Guy survives a crash,
only to get taken out two months later.

267
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,300
- I gotta take this.
- Thank you.

268
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,664
No new messages.

269
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,583
To listen to saved messages, press 9.

270
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,794
It's me.

271
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,088
Jessica, I mean.

272
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,346
I don't even know
if you check this number.

273
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,060
Um, I need to talk.

274
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,442
Oh. You scared me.

275
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,403
Who were you calling?

276
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,654
Nobody.

277
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,575
That's funny. It sounded
like you were calling somebody.

278
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,180
Jessica Arndt. Pretty girl.
Dead on the scene.

279
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,017
Blunt-force head injury
from the rollover. No seat belt.

280
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,645
Do you still have her x-rays?

281
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,735
Arndt. Here we go.

282
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,238
In your report
you identified two previous fractures...

283
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,741
...a broken wrist and cracked rib.
- Mm-hm.

284
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,492
May I?

285
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,999
Is that a spiral fracture?

286
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,709
I suppose it is.

287
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,005
She'd get that
from having her wrist twisted hard.

288
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,925
- As opposed to falling on it, right?
- Come here.

289
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,468
You're hurting me.

290
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,012
One other thing.

291
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,848
You listed her cause of death...

292
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,100
...as blunt-force trauma to the head
and broken neck.

293
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,560
As I said.

294
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,230
Could someone suffer those injuries...

295
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,441
...if the car's front
and side airbags deployed?

296
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:40,196
Not likely, but a body is subjected
to extreme forces in a crash like that.

297
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,366
Is it possible she had these injuries
before the accident?

298
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,993
- You're hurting my arm.
- Get back here!

299
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,374
Oh, no, baby, baby, Jess.

300
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,918
Hey.

301
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,424
Detective, I don't know
what cases you're used to seeing...

302
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,719
...but up here, car crashes account
for most of my business.

303
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,681
Just because something's possible
doesn't mean it's probable.

304
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,101
Excuse me.

305
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,311
- Carter.
- Detective.

306
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,356
I'm heading to speak with Arndt's
family, his mother-in-law.

307
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,817
- See if she knew anything.
- Send me the address.

308
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,986
- I'll meet you there.
- All right, will do.

309
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:26,284
I'm watching Sarah's apartment
and I'm tracking the GPS on her phone.

310
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,662
I've also discovered new information
about her husband.

311
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,540
According to the Denver
public records database...

312
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:36,585
...Jennings was sued twice
for excessive use of force on the job.

313
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,838
Both cases were dismissed.

314
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,508
He falsified the warrants on Sarah.

315
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,012
Trumped up the charges to enlist
the entire U. S. Marshals Service...

316
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,098
...into helping him.
- That's why she can't stop running.

317
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,225
Only one way
to deal with guys like this.

318
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,145
Guys who hide who they really are
until they get home.

319
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,355
What will you do, Mr. Reese?

320
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,483
Show him what a real monster
looks like.

321
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,917
Detective... Uh, what was it, Stills?

322
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,753
Have a change of heart
about me questioning...?

323
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,802
Your fellow deputies know why you're
here?

324
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,471
Chasing your terrified wife?

325
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,477
If you come after her again,
I will kill you.

326
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,896
No one will be able
to protect you from me.

327
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,026
Do you understand?

328
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,255
Finch, we're gonna wanna move Sarah
to a safer location.

329
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,966
Agreed. And then maybe
you can explain the wisdom...

330
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,887
...of antagonizing an entire
law-enforcement agency.

331
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,110
Mr. Reese, we have a problem.

332
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,492
- Hi. Uh, one-way to New Haven, please.
- Sure, just need photo ID.

333
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,624
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

334
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,131
Something wrong?

335
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,070
Stop right there.
Get down on the ground.

336
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,990
Karen Garner,
we have a warrant for your arrest.

337
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,034
Suspect in custody. Track 20.

338
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,538
- Yes, detective?
- I just heard on the radio...

339
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:21,167
...your girl got popped at the train station.
Picked her up on a marshals BOLO.

340
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,335
- Where is she now?
- Probably still there.

341
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,713
Cops will hold her
until marshals pick her up.

342
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,341
Thanks, detective.
We have to get to the train station.

343
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,603
We're too late.
Jennings picked her up.

344
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,190
With his cover blown, he can't take her
home through official channels.

345
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,734
He's gonna make her disappear, Finch.

346
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,653
We need to get to her.

347
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,656
I may have a way.

348
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,955
Government vehicles now have mobile
hotspots for Internet access, like this.

349
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,999
- That include marshal vehicles?
- Yes.

350
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,792
So I can get into their network.

351
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,755
The trick will be figuring out
which vehicle is Jennings'.

352
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,927
- That's him. West Side Highway.
- He's taking her out of the city.

353
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,971
- Get out.
- Excuse me?

354
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,184
Leave the laptop. Now, Harold.

355
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,102
And get out.

356
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,831
Your daughter was so beautiful.

357
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,459
Oh, thank you.

358
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:50,464
- Were you two close?
- Very. We spoke most every day.

359
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,843
So you said you had some questions
about Peter?

360
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,971
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Uh, prior to his disappearance...

361
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,140
...were you aware of your son-in-law's
financial difficulties?

362
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:05,145
No. Peter had a good job.
He was a good provider.

363
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:11,151
Based on our information, he owed
more than $3 million to various entities.

364
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:18,450
Well, Jessica once mentioned that
they were going through a rough patch...

365
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,370
...but that Peter
was turning things around.

366
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,871
That was just before the accident.

367
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,624
Excuse me.

368
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,796
When you said Jessica told you
they were going through a rough patch...

369
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,674
...was she talking about money
or her and Peter?

370
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,135
Oh, no, Jessica and Peter
had a good marriage.

371
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,471
I mean, they had problems
like any married couple, but...

372
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,307
Detective, see you a minute?

373
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:48,022
I just got a call that a guy in a suit
assaulted four deputy marshals...

374
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,857
...in their downtown office.
- What?

375
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,319
I'm heading there to follow up.
Mind wrapping up with the mother?

376
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,155
- It looks like a dead end.
- Sure.

377
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,703
- Carter.
- What's this about an incident...

378
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,913
...with four marshals?
- It's under control.

379
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,208
- Are you sure? Doesn't sound like it.
- Yes, detective.

380
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,253
So how's your New Rochelle
investigation going?

381
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,132
Donnelly hasn't found anything so far,
but I think I have.

382
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,383
Oh?

383
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,094
Yeah, I think Arndt killed his wife
and covered it up.

384
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,639
The kind of thing you guys
usually intervene in...

385
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,058
...except this time your partner
was too late.

386
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,560
Still don't understand John's
connection to this.

387
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,771
Sure there isn't anything
you can tell me?

388
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,190
I'm sure you'll make sense of it,
detective.

389
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,824
You were saying something about
problems between Jessica and Peter.

390
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,077
Oh, you know, just little spats.

391
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,953
Not even worth mentioning.

392
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,624
Do you know if these spats ever
went beyond words?

393
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,418
I'm not sure what you mean.

394
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,420
Did they become physical?

395
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,756
What is it you're suggesting?

396
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,846
Nothing. Just some routine questions.

397
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,349
I should get going.
I'm sorry for troubling you.

398
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,643
Peter had his faults.

399
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,937
But he loved Jessica.

400
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,814
And she loved him.

401
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,608
I'm sure she did, ma'am.

402
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:20,447
He was so much better
than her usual type.

403
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,203
She was seeing someone
before Peter?

404
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,789
She had a fling with a soldier.

405
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,291
Back when she was living in Tacoma.

406
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,044
This soldier,
do you remember his name?

407
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,881
No. They weren't together very long.

408
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,510
He was always away on duty
and then she'd be alone.

409
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,137
That wasn't the life for her.

410
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,808
He told her the same thing,
told her not to wait for him.

411
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,313
However sometimes I now wonder...

412
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,650
...if she had waited for him,
maybe things could have worked out.

413
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,319
Maybe she would be happy.

414
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,655
And we'd talk again.

415
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:08,078
Can I ask, do you have any pictures
of this man?

416
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,580
I don't.

417
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,667
But I still have some of Jessica's things.
You're welcome to look through them...

418
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,794
...if you like.
- Sure.

419
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,724
Jessica.

420
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,061
Oh, yeah, I got engaged.

421
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,398
His name's Peter.

422
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,987
That's one of the things
you learn over there.

423
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,740
In the end, we're all alone.

424
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,492
And no one's coming to save you.

425
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,078
Be happy with Peter.

426
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,080
You don't believe that.

427
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,252
Tell me to wait for you and...

428
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,921
Say those words and I will.

429
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,801
Listen, it's a party, okay?
Could you stop being so...

430
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,511
- Hey!
- Hey, cheers!

431
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,933
Listen, it's a party, okay?
Could you stop being...

432
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,815
In the end, we're all alone.

433
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,901
And no one's coming to save you.

434
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,779
Gene?

435
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,364
Hey, Joss Carter.

436
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,908
Good. Listen, I need a favor.

437
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,161
Personnel file. First name John.

438
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:17,457
Special Forces, stationed at Fort Lewis
between June and September of '01.

439
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,293
My eyes only.

440
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,545
Yeah, thanks, Gene.

441
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,972
Mr. Reese?
- What is it, Finch?

442
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,392
What exactly is your plan once you
catch up to Deputy Jennings?

443
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,352
To get Sarah away from him.

444
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,812
And Jennings?

445
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,648
Jennings had his chance.

446
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,233
He didn't take it.

447
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:47,487
I think under the circumstances it might
be good to bring police in on this one.

448
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,698
You hired me to take care
of these things.

449
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,993
You don't like how I do it,
hire someone else.

450
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,745
Mr. Reese?

451
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,663
John?

452
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,592
Carter.
- Hello, detective.

453
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,510
This New Rochelle business.

454
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,013
The car accident, the cover-up,
Jessica.

455
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,848
You knew what I'd find, didn't you?

456
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,434
- Knowing isn't always a blessing.
- True.

457
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,771
But I confess, I was calling with a more
John.

458
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,233
- Don't tell me you've lost him again.
- No, I know where he is, I just...

459
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,694
...can't reach him.

460
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,863
Or stop him.

461
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,376
Why are we here, Brad?

462
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,798
I wanted us to have some time together,
baby. Just you and me.

463
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,428
I don't know how things got
so out of hand with us.

464
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,889
But I promise, I'm gonna fix it.

465
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,560
You don't have to run anymore.

466
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,234
You believe me, right?

467
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,571
I do. I do believe you. I do...

468
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,081
So maybe we can take these off now?

469
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,554
You never did know what to say,
did you?

470
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,278
I know what you're thinking.
That this is my fault.

471
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,739
That somehow I wanted this.

472
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:57,951
But have you ever considered how hard
this has been for me?

473
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,078
The trouble I've gone to for you?

474
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,622
What's it gonna take, Sarah?

475
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,168
I love you so much.

476
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,964
But I can't do this anymore.

477
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,425
No.

478
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,908
Go.

479
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,577
- Where?
- Anywhere you want.

480
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,662
You're free.

481
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,585
Thank you.

482
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,088
Sarah.

483
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,717
She's gone. It's over.

484
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,181
- Something funny?
- You've never been in love, have you?

485
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,020
Really, truly in love.

486
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,191
- Why?
- Because then you'd know.

487
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,777
It'll never be over.

488
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,321
It is for you.

489
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,517
Your friend told me
I might find you up this way.

490
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,855
I can't let you take him, John.

491
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,649
This can't end like New Rochelle.

492
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,946
- Do I need to look in the trunk?
- You can do whatever you like.

493
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,532
Isn't gonna change what I have to do.

494
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,076
Let me have him, John.

495
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,289
- If I do, he'll get away with it.
- I'll see that he doesn't.

496
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,043
It won't be up to you. That's my point.

497
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,257
There are things you can do, detective,
and things you can't.

498
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,758
And that's where I come in.

499
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,636
I can't allow you
to just execute people.

500
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,889
This isn't on you.

501
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,932
It's on me.

502
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,603
All I'm asking for is your trust.

503
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,646
What, for you to do the right thing?

504
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,358
That I'll do what needs to be done.

505
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,121
Oh, yeah, Jess loves him.
Don't you, babe?

506
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,127
- Best move we ever made.
- That's right.

507
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,552
Did Sullivan send you?

508
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:09,184
Is this supposed to be
some kind of, uh, intimidation?

509
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,727
I don't have his money.

510
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,732
You don't have anything I want.

511
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,110
Not anymore.

512
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,529
Who the hell are you?

513
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,949
That's a good question.

514
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,828
Haven't known the answer
for a long time.

515
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,124
I know who I was.

516
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,880
I was the guy who left her behind.

517
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,174
You know why? The real reason?

518
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,970
Because I thought she deserved
someone better than me.

519
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,559
I thought she deserved someone
who would look after her.

520
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,980
Be there for her.

521
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,110
I thought she deserved
someone like you.

522
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,990
So I don't know.

523
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,284
I was hoping you could tell me.

524
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,411
Tell you what?

525
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,038
Who I'm supposed to be now.

526
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,667
Now that she's gone.

527
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,961
See...

528
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,465
...when you find that one person
who connects you to the world...

529
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,927
...you become someone different.

530
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,388
Someone better.

531
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,643
When that person is taken from you...

532
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,397
...what do you become then?

533
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,812
I was beginning to wonder when
I'd hear from you again.

534
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,940
I had some business to take care of
out of town.

535
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:25,570
I trust you now fully appreciate why
I couldn't tell you about Sarah's case.

536
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,783
I hope you now understand
why you should have.

537
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,087
Did you know?

538
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,384
Was she one of those numbers
that came up again and again?

539
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,470
What I know, Mr. Reese...

540
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,724
...is that New Rochelle happened
before we started working together.

541
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,478
Because of that, there was nothing
that either one of us could have done.

542
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,073
I forgot to include that
in your birthday present.

543
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,825
Must have slipped my mind.

544
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,348
- Hello?
- Detective Carter?

545
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,434
This is Warden Gustavo Pena.

546
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,353
- I'm calling from Torreón Penitentiary.
- Yes?

547
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,648
I have been asked to inform you
we have your fugitive in custody.

548
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,650
- My fugitive?
- Yes.

549
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,653
A Marshal Jennings
delivered him to us...

550
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,073
...along with 10 kilos of uncut heroin
found in his possession.

551
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,953
Uh, this marshal, just so I'm clear...

552
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,373
...was he tall, dark hair, in a suit?
- That's him.

553
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,918
He said you were
the original arresting officer...

554
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,587
...informed me to tell you
we have him in custody.

555
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,924
- He's going to be here for a long time.
- Thank you, warden.

556
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:55,553
One other thing. Do you have any other
Americans in your prison?

557
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:59,224
- One or two.
- Thanks.

558
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,243
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

559
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,871
Jessica died in a car accident.

560
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,087
Sorry.

561
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,850
I'm so sorry.
